# Matthew Ao
👋🏼 Hey there! I'm a computer engineering undergrad at the University of Toronto, and a founding engineer at [Omni](https://omnilabs.ai/).

At Omni, we're building [💬 Omni Chat](https://omnilabs.ai/chat), which is basically ChatGPT for your documents. You can upload PDFs, word docs, epubs, md/txt files, and even entire webpages--and proceed to chat and generate high quality writing using the knowledge in your uploads.

Aside from my work at Omni, I also do freelance web development for [high profile clients](https://bruceliu.matthewao.com). You can check out my work at [matthewao.com](https://matthewao.com)!
