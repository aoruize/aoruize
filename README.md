# Matthew Ao
👋🏼 Hey there! I'm a a founding engineer at [Omni](https://omnilabs.ai/), and an ECE student at UToronto.

At Omni, we're building [💬 Omni Chat](https://omnilabs.ai/chat), which is basically ChatGPT for your documents. 

You can upload PDFs, word docs, epubs, md/txt files, and even entire webpages--and Omni chat will respond *using your knowledge.*

Aside from my work at Omni, I also do freelance web development for [high profile clients](https://bruceliu.matthewao.com). You can check out my work at [matthewao.com](https://matthewao.com)!
