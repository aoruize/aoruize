# Matthew Ao
👋🏼 Hey there! I'm a a founding engineer at [Omni](https://omnilabs.ai/), and an ECE student at UToronto. 

Currently building [💬 Omni Chat](https://omnilabs.ai/chat)—think of it as ChatGPT for your documents.
You can upload unlimited personal or team files/folders—and Omni chat will respond *using your knowledge.* 

Aside from my work at Omni, I also do freelance web development for [high profile clients](https://bruceliu.matthewao.com). You can check out my work at [matthewao.com](https://matthewao.com)!
