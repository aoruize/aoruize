# Matthew Ao
👋🏼 Hey there! I'm a a founding engineer at [Omni](https://omnilabs.ai/), and an ECE student at UToronto.

At Omni, we're building [💬 Omni Chat](https://omnilabs.ai/chat), which is basically ChatGPT for your documents. 

You can upload datasets of personal or team documents--and Omni chat will respond *using your knowledge.* 

Currently, you can upload PDF, Doc/Docx, EPUB, MD, TXT, Org, and HTML files. You can even upload entire websites!

Aside from my work at Omni, I also do freelance web development for [high profile clients](https://bruceliu.matthewao.com). 

You can check out my work at [matthewao.com](https://matthewao.com)!
